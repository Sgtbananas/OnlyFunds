✅ PROJECT TIMELINE: FINAL BUILD PLAN FOR ONLYFUNDS
Each phase is modular, ensuring your system makes real profit, with full control, ML-driven logic, and optional live trading.

🔹 PHASE 1 — STABLE CORE REBUILD ✅ (CURRENT)
🧩 Goal: Make the app run error-free with placeholders stubbed in

 Fix all import errors

 Reinstate main.py execution logic

 Add fallback trading + signal engines (simulate, dry run)

 Enable strategy stacking (ema, rsi, macd, bollinger, trend_score)

 Streamlit UI restored with mode + profile selection

 top 200 CoinEx pair selection fetched live

 ML filter enabled

👉 Where we are now

🔹 PHASE 2 — BACKTESTING ENGINE REPLACEMENT 🔄 (IN PROGRESS)
🎯 Goal: Replace simulate_trades() with full strategy-aware trading logic

 Load price data into enriched indicator frame

 Apply entry/exit logic using:

Signal gating (meta + trend + volatility)

SL / TP / Trailing Stop

 Enforce 1 USDT or 5% of profit position sizing logic

 Log PnL, Win %, Avg return

⏱ ETA: ~1 work session

🔹 PHASE 3 — DRY RUN MODE
🚦 Goal: Live paper trades with full logs

 Hook up place_live_order() to dry-run executor

 Add visual trade ledger (Streamlit table)

 Timestamp + log each decision

⏱ ETA: 1 session after Phase 2

🔹 PHASE 4 — LIVE TRADING ENGINE
💸 Goal: Trade real money using CoinEx

 Add CoinEx API interface (w/ secret key injection)

 Route place_live_order() to live trades when enabled

 Position state manager: open, closed, cancel, fail

 Rate limit and fallback failovers

⚠️ Manual toggle (config.yaml) to protect capital

⏱ ETA: ~1–2 sessions

🔹 PHASE 5 — ML AUTOTUNING + PROFIT MODE
🧠 Goal: Automatically learn best parameters for entry/exit/profit maximization

 Meta model selects regime + strategy

 Confidence gating

 Threshold autotune

 Strategy rotation when performance drops

⏱ ETA: Ongoing after live launch
