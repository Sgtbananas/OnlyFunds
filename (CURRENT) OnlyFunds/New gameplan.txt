Below is a multi-pronged blueprint designed to maximize your odds of turning 10 USDT into as close to 200 USDT as realistically possible—blending high-frequency scalping, grid & arbitrage, ML-driven signals, sentiment overlays, and rock-solid risk controls across dozens of pairs. Taken together, these tactics aim for ~1 % per trade with ~200 trades, while still preserving a conservative sleeve for steady compounding.

Strategy Overview
Deploy an ensemble of complementary tactics rather than a single “silver bullet” model. Each sub-strategy captures a different edge—scalping quick 1 % gains, exploiting grid and arbitrage inefficiencies, riding momentum breakouts, and harnessing AI/ML and sentiment signals. By trading across 50+ liquid pairs with low latency, you accumulate 200+ micro-profits, aiming to compound toward 200 USDT in a day.

1. Grid Trading Across Many Pairs
Use a grid trading system that places staggered buy/sell orders at fixed intervals around the current price, capturing small oscillations. Modern open-source backtest engines like FreedX allow precise simulation of grid parameters to fit your risk profile

. By deploying independent grids on 20–30 major alt-pairs, you can harvest dozens of 0.5–1 % moves per pair per day.

2. Triangular & Cross-Exchange Arbitrage
Triangular arbitrage exploits fleeting price differences between three pairs on a single exchange (e.g. BTC/USDT ⇄ ETH/USDT ⇄ ETH/BTC)

. When conditions arise, you convert USDT→BTC→ETH→USDT in one atomic cycle, pocketing the spread. Automating this across multiple exchanges (Binance, Kraken, Bybit) adds further opportunity, provided your latency and capital are sufficient.

3. High-Frequency Scalping & Momentum
Implement scalping bots to target ~1 % profit per trade using micro-trend signals and tight limit orders

. Combine with a volatility momentum breakout filter that only enters when price breaks above Bollinger Bands with rising RSI to avoid whipsaws

. Across 50+ symbols, this can yield 100–150 legitimately small wins in a trading day.

4. Market Making for Passive Spread Capture
As a market maker, post “at-the-touch” orders on both sides of the book with small spreads (e.g. 0.2 %) to earn rebates and spreads whenever takers arrive 
Hacker Noon
. Spread your capital over dozens of order pairs; even if each fill nets only 0.1–0.2 %, the volume can add up to significant daily gains.

5. Machine Learning & AI Signal Fusion
Leverage ML classifiers and reinforcement-learning agents to forecast short-term price moves and adapt to regime changes 
ScienceDirect
. Stack multiple models (e.g. random forests, LSTM, DQN, PPO) and ensemble their outputs into a composite “strength” score. Only take trades when ensemble confidence > 0.7 to boost win rate.

6. Sentiment & Alternative Data Overlay
Augment price/volume with social sentiment (Twitter/X, Reddit, on-chain flows) to time entries ahead of crowded moves

. A sudden surge in bullish mentions often precedes sharp upward moves; combine sentiment thresholds with your scalping engine to filter late-day rallies.

7. Rigorous Risk & Money Management
Stop-loss / take-profit: Cap losses at –0.5 % and lock in winners at +1 % to maintain a positive expectancy

Volatility scaling: Adjust position sizes by recent realized volatility so each trade carries similar dollar risk across symbols

.

Minimum order sizes: Enforce exchange lot‐size minimums to avoid dust orders.

Drawdown kill-switch: Halt all trading if cumulative P&L drops > 5 % intraday.

8. Implementation & Infrastructure
Data pipeline: Stream WebSocket order-book + tick data into Redis or kdb+.

Feature store: Precompute indicators, sentiment scores, and arbitrage spreads in memory.

Execution engine: Co-locate your bots in low-latency environments; use REST/WebSocket for real-time order management.

Backtester: Vectorized engine supporting multi-strategy, multi-pair walk-forward testing.

Monitoring: Dashboards for live P&L, fill rates, latency, and risk metrics; automatic throttling on anomalies.

Realistic trade count: To hit 200 trades/day, you can run 4 bots × 50 pairs × ~1 fill/hour each, or 20 bots × 10 pairs × ~2 fills/hour each. With 1 % average profit per fill and strict risk controls, compounding across dozens of concurrent streams brings you much closer to the 200 USDT goal—while still preserving a conservative sleeve for steadier compounding.

This ensemble, high-leverage, multi-edge design is the closest you’ll get to a “best-in-class” crypto system—balancing aggressive 1 % scalps with robust controls to manage volatility and drawdowns across hundreds of trades. Good luck building!
