Here’s a quick rundown of what you now have:

🧠 Intelligence Layer
Autotune + Threshold Optimization via core/autotune.py

Signal Smoothing & Adaptive Scoring in core/core_signals.py

🧩 Configuration + Control
.env = env vars (secure, portable)

api_config.json + strategy_config.json = persistent tuning state + exchange handling

config_loader.py = typed access to .env and configs

⚙️ Infrastructure
Modular directories:
